Innovation and entrepreneurship training project (National level): Monitoring of poaching during the forbidden fishing period of the East China Sea based on the nighttime light images — Leader

Description
======
* The project stood out from 1,102 projects to be one of 150 national student research projects (¥10000 in funding)
* Utilized an improved vessel detection algorithm to extract fishing vessel pixels from nighttime light images (100G+).
* Applied KNN Algorithm, Concave Analysis, Kernel Density Analysis to explore the spatiotemporal pattern of light seine ﬁshing during forbidden fishing periods.
* 1 paper published (1st author, International Journal of Remote Sensing, IF=2.5, Doi:10.1080/01431161.2018.1524605)
