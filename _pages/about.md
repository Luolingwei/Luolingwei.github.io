Hi! I'm Lingwei Luo, a graduate student at [College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University](http://www.ues.pku.edu.cn/). This is the front page of my personal website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/Luolingwei/Luolingwei.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages.

Most of my previous work focused on Remote Sening and Geography, but I have been focusing on Data Mining, Machine Learning and Algorithm since 2018. I aim to work as a Data Engineer/Software Development Engineer in the near future.

I received my B.S.in GIS from [School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University](http://sres.whu.edu.cn/). And I am currently applying to 19 fall DS/CS programs in the United States.
