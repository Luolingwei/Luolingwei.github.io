Hi! I'm Lingwei Luo (罗翎玮), I graduated from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) with a Master's degree in Computer Science. Currently, I am working as a software engineer at [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google).

Most of my previous work focused on Data Science, Remote Sening and Geography. Since year 2017, I have been focusing on Software Engineering, Data Mining and Algorithm.

I received my B.S. in GIS from [School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University](http://sres.whu.edu.cn/English/Home.htm). And I also studied in [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) for 1 year as a research assistant from 2018 to 2019.
