Hi! I'm Lingwei Luo (罗翎玮), a graduate student at [College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University](http://www.ues.pku.edu.cn/).

Most of my previous work focused on Data Science, Remote Sening and Geography. Since year 2017, I have been focusing on Data Mining, Machine Learning and Algorithm. I plan to work as a Data Engineer/Software Development Engineer in the near future.

I received my B.S. in GIS from [School of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Wuhan University](http://sres.whu.edu.cn/). And I am currently applying to 19 fall DS/CE/CS programs in the United States.
